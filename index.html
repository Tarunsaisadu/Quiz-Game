<!--/* QUIZ GAME! RULES: / The player must guess correctly a certain amount of
questions / Each correct answer gives him one point / Answers could be multiple
or true/false / At the end of the game, the user must know his/her total score

QUESTIONS: / You can get them from this URL ( http://bit.ly/strive_QUIZZ ) or
you can write your own / Could be multiple of boolean (true / false) / [EXTRA]

 HINTS: / Keep a global variable score for the user score / Keep a
variable questionNumber for the question the user is answering / When
questionNumber is bigger then the available questions, present the score / Start
working with the questions saved in a variable (or you can use AJAX for fetching
external questions if you already know it!) / Start with the easier version and
THEN implement the EXTRAs / Please debug everything / try it on the console to
be sure of what to expect from your code
